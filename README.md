# Star First Last
Write a 'star_first_last()' function that takes in a single word and replaces the first and last letter with an asterix. The function will return the modified word.

Examples:

```stars_first_last('buffalo') ==> '*uffal*'```

```stars_first_last('watermelon') ==> '*atermelo*'```

<br></br>
<br></br>

# Initials

Write an `initials()` function that takes a first and last name as arguments then returns their initials following the format below.

Examples:

```initials("Tracy", "Turtle")``` ==> `"T.T."`


`initials("Peter", "Parker")`==> `"P.P."`


<br></br>
<br></br>

# Sandwich

In this exercise, write a function called `sandwich()` which takes a 5-letter string. Your function should return the letters that are at the beginning, the middle and end of the string. It should not include letters at the first or third index.

Examples:

`sandwich("horse")` ==> `"hre"`

`sandwich("slate")` ==> `"sae"`

<br></br>
<br></br>


# End of Word

Write the function called `end_of_word()` that takes a string and returns everything but the first character.

Examples:

```end_of_word("boat")``` ==> `"oat"`

```end_of_word("mice")``` ==> `"ice"`

<br></br>
<br></br>


# Replace at Index
Write the function named `replace_at_index()` that takes a string and an integer. The function should return a new string that is the same as the old string, EXCEPT with a dash in place of whatever character was at the index indicated by the integer.

### Do not use the .replace() method

Examples:

`replace_at_index("eggplant", 3)` ==> ```"egg-lant"```


`replace_at_index("strange", 0)`==> `"-trange"`
```
